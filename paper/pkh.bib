Provides a solution of the Smoluchowski equation under a number of scenarios, including a gated channel. Fig 1. gives the basic systems (ranging from a stochastically reactive binding site, to a channel with a gated entrance and stochastic reactive site). The starting point is the Smol. eqn in (2.1). The Laplace transform sol'n pertains to time-dependent solutions, which I presume we could neglect for now. (3.1) describes a coupled reaction-diffusion equation for closed and open binding sites. (5.1) handles the stochastic gating, although I haven't yet made sense of his approach just yet.

Zhou has an interesting review on estimating rate constants in (). Around equation 3.41 he discusses Kramer's approach for estimating rate constant by the ratio of stdy state flux and the reactant population

K = J/C

If you consider the reaction as a diffusive process with an absorbing boundary at the product state, he shows ultimately derives an expression for the rate constant(3.45) that is a function of the diffusion constant and the potential energy surface. 

Zhou extends in this 4.6 to model the dissociation rate constant for a spherical potential. 

In both cases you have to define the location of the maximum energy barrier (saddle point). I'm not sure how difficult this is for a real system -- perhaps this is easier to identify for reactions dominated by electrostatic interactions.
